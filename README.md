#HIWAT
The High-Impact Weather Assessment Toolkit (HIWAT) uses a mesoscale numerical weather prediction model and the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) constellation of satellites to assess high-impact convective weather events over the Hindu Kush Himalayan region. The toolkit includes a suite of ensemble model forecasts to constrain the uncertainties and provides a 54-hour probabilistic forecast for improved decision making. HIWAT provides outlooks for lightning strikes, high-impact winds, high rainfall rates, hail, and other weather events.
